# A site for Caleb Herron
A personal website for a client of mine. He is a percussionist/producer based in Atlanta and needed a responsive website where one can get more info, book him for gigs, book him for drumming lessons, and see the upcoming events he is involved with.

This project contained a lot of firsts for me. This was my first time using NodeJS, utilizing "lazy-loading", and building a custom playback UI from scratch. I used NodeJS to develop the contact form which configures and sends outgoing email via NodeMailer. I much preferred this method in comparison to using PHP, I love that you can use Javascript as a language for back-end.The lazy loading was done with a lot of help from the IntersectionObserver API. Creating the music player was done with vanilla JS and taught me a ton about event delegation, which I didn't have to worry about as much in other projects.  As always, I have learned a lot from this project and am grateful for the opportunity to try things I've never done before!
