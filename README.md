# A site for Caleb Herron
A personal website for a client of mine. He is a percussionist/producer based in Atlanta and needed a responsive website where one can get more info, book him for gigs, book him for drumming lessons, and see the upcoming events he is involved with.

This is the first project I've used NodeJS and "lazy-loading" on. The lazy loading was done with a lot of help from the IntersectionObserver API and the contact form configures and sends outgoing emails with NodeMailer. I much preferred this method in comparison to using PHP, I love that you can use Javascript as a language for back-end. As always, I have learned a lot from this proiject and am grateful for the opportunity to try things I've never done before!
